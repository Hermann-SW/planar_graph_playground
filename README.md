# planar_graph_playground
JavaScript playground for drawing planar graphs (eg. fullerenes) in browser.

## gaus-jordan.js

Simple Node.JS solver for system of linear equations module is taken from:  
[https://github.com/lovasoa/linear-solve/blob/master/gauss-jordan.js](https://github.com/lovasoa/linear-solve/blob/master/gauss-jordan.js)

Made it usable for browser JavaScript by changing 1 line and deleting 5 lines only.

## assert.js

```assert()``` for JavaScript, with file and line number logged in console.

## undirected_graph.js

Implementation of undirect graph as well as embedding functions.  

Just ```forall_edges(G, f)``` as example ...

	function forall_edges(G, f) {
	    var v;
	    for (v = 0; v < G.length; v += 1) {
	        G[v].forEach(function (w) {
	            if (v < w) {
	                f(v, w);
	            }
	        });
	    }
	}

... used to draw SVG lines for all edges like this:  

	  forall_edges(G, function(v, w){
	    cx=l/2+(l/2-r)*coords[0][v];
	    cy=l/2+(l/2-r)*coords[1][v];
	    dx=l/2+(l/2-r)*coords[0][w];
	    dy=l/2+(l/2-r)*coords[1][w];
	    document.write('<line class="l" x1="'+cx+'" y1="'+cy+'" x2="'+dx+'" y2="'+dy+'"></line>');
	  })

## tutte.js

Function ```tutte(Emb, face, factor)``` computes x/y coordinates for convex planar straight line drawings of embedding ```Emb```, with array ```face``` vertices on the outer face.

## fullerenes.js

Sample fullerenes C20, C30, ..., C70 adjacency lists.

## htmlsvg.js

Function ```header``` writes select and slider elements of HTML page to ```document```.

Function ``'straight_line_drawing(G, coords, length, r)``` creates SVG output of size length√ólength, with straight line drawing of graph G with vertex array coords coordinates, and vertex label radius r.

## index.html

Browser demo application for drawing fullerenes C20, C30, ..., C70, with quite some browser interaction. See this forum posting for current details:

Just learned how to setup Github Pages, and how to add submodule. After few minutes submodule ```planar_graph_playground``` was public, you can play now with the demo aplication!

Latest commits made edge selection different. Now you just cick on an edge,
and the edge vertex closer to mouse cursor becomes top vertex of outer face,
and selected edge becomes top right edge:

With new commits outer face can be filled as well now.  
So for fullerenes,
always 12 pentagons are filled, regardless of outer face vertex count:
